      <p>I am a full-stack software engineer with an eye for UX design. I am a big picture thinker with an attention to detail. My experience completing my first album taught me the importance of leadership, collaboration, and seeing a project through to fruition, helping me to give and receive feedback effectively when working with other developers, and to understand the importance of working cohesively towards the completion of a final product. I want to inspire people to learn and grow through engaging software.</p>
